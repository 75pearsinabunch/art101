	<h1>Lab 4 Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
		<p> The idea of this lab was to think like a programmer.
			By writting out what is needed for the program before actually programming.</p>
		<hr>
	<div>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>It was easy making a pseudocode.
				The challenge was thinking about an everyday task as a program with its set of instructions.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>The problem was making sure the instructions were High-level instructions.
				Where it is generic enough to explain good instructions but not to specfic explaing every single detail.</p>
	</div>

	<hr></hr>

	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>You can't see the computer pseudocode because it is commented out in the .js file.
			However, if someone were to open the file in a text editor, then they can see the comments made.
			is the file structure that I made:</p>
			<div>
				<p>Task 1: Everyday Task - Making a grilled cheese sandwhich</p>
				<img src="img/gcs.jpg">
				<div>
					<ol style="float: left; min-width: 550px;">
						<li>Go to the kitchen</li>
						<li>Grab some bread, butter, cheese, and a pan</li>
						<li>Turn on the stove</li>
						<li>Put the pan on the fire to heat up the pan</li>
						<li>Add some butter to the pan</li>
						<li>Lower the temperture and add two bread to the butter</li>
						<li>Put cheese on one side of both breads</li>
						<li>Flip one bread to the other bread where both cheese sides are connecting</li>
						<li>Flip sandwhich</li>
						<li>Remove sandwhich from pan to a plate</li>
						<li>Eat the sandwhich</li>
					<ol>
				</div>

				<p>Task 2: Computer Task - How to make a "Hello world" in Python</p>
				<div>
					<pre>
						// Turn on a computer
						// Open a web browser
						// Search "Python Online IDE" in the search bar
						// Select a website from the search request
						   // Type into the text box "print("Hello world")"
						// Click run or go (depending the website)
						// Enjoy python
