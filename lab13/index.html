    <h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
    <p>Working with your partner, experiment with loops.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Making sure that the logic follows through the conditions so that it does not
      get stuck producing the same answer for a different input or breaking.</p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I always have troubles with loops because of edge casing. What usually helps if I draw it out and figure out where the input goes into.
        Console.log really helps to see which information is being catched by my if-else statements.
        I couldn't figure out the bonus task except for doing it in javascript. I did the make main task in JQuery.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Here is the output of my program.</p>
